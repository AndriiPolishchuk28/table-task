# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project is a React application that showcases a user management table with filtering capabilities. The goal of this task is to evaluate and demonstrate skills in creating a React application using Redux (either the Classic Redux approach or Redux Toolkit) and TypeScript.

## Features

- **Fetch User Data:** Retrieve and display user information from a mock API.
- **Local Filtering:** Implement filtering functionality to allow users to search and filter the table based on user attributes (e.g., name, username, email, phone).
- **State Management:** Use Redux Toolkit to manage the application's state effectively, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
- **TypeScript Integration:** Ensure type safety and improve code reliability by using TypeScript throughout the application.
- **Responsive UI:** Implement a user interface that is responsive and user-friendly.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux Toolkit:** A powerful toolset for efficient Redux development.
- **TypeScript:** A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **Material-UI:** A popular React UI framework for building aesthetically pleasing components.
- **Axios:** Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
